# COTOBA Agent dialogue engine
------------
COTOBA Agent dialogue engine is an AIML dialogue description language processing engine written in Python3.  
Contains programs for building your own interactions using the Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML).  
The COTOBA Agent dialogue engine supports tags defined in the interactive language AIML2.0.  
In addition, we extend our own extensions, such as tags that handle json, tags that call the REST interface, and tags that use the results of advanced interpretation.  
The interactive description language can support multilingual input, and the program supports Japanese and English, and it is possible to support multiple languages by adding its own tokenize processing.
